SimianGrid documentation
========================

Docs here use reStructuredText
[ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html ] markup.  Its advantage is
that it's human-readable without having to install any software.  In
fact, this document you're reading is using reST.

If, however, you want to generate PDFs, man pages, HTML files, or
other versions of the SimianGrid documentation, you can use the Sphinx
document generator [ http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ ].  Just install Python,
then: ::

    easy_install sphinx
    easy_install rst2pdf

to fulfil the dependencies, then: ::

    make pdf

and look in the ``docs/build`` directory for the output.  Run ``make``
with no options to see all available formats.  This should work on
both *nix variants and Windows.
